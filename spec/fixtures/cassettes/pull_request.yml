        tracker story [#76291634](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/76291634)
        in project *Bookings*:\r\n\r\n> As a Product Manager I would like to test
        having the purple bar on the full-page PPP so that I can see if that attracts
        more users to check availability and find\r\n> \r\n> **Notes:**\r\n> \r\n>
        - This is desktop only\r\n> \r\n> - The tabbed version should look exactly
        as it does today, with the white booking bar\r\n> \r\n> - The full-page version
        should have the purple booking bar and the new tabs\r\n> \r\n> - See attached
        for the mock-up of the anchor links navigation which go with the purple booking
        bar (they look the same as the tabs on the tabbed version basically!)\r\n>
        \r\n> - The version of the purple booking bar that is currently on the full-page
        PPP A/B test looks good. I think Alessandro just \"shoved up\" Seb''s code
        onto Staging in a temporary way to get this working on Staging so it will
        need reworking. The change to purple on Staging was in this story - https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/75898544\r\n>
        \r\n> - Please can we use these for the feature flag, A/B test and Kissmetrics
        info?\r\n> \r\n> --> Feature flag = \"Full page PPP\" (new, we didn''t have
        a feature flag for the first version and we should have this time)\r\n> -->
        Kissmetrics property \"Full page PPP\" = \"Yes\" or \"No\" (same as first
        version)\r\n> --> Abingo \"Full page ppp\" and \"Tabbed ppp\" (same as first
        version)\r\n> \r\n> - For the A/B test, mobile and IE8 users should not be
        participants in the test either for ABingo or Kissmetrics\r\n> \r\n> **Test
        plan:**\r\n> \r\n> 1. Test purple booking bar and new tabs A/B test (scrolling,
        anchor links aren''t covered by booking bar, red bar for unavailability, green
        bar for available, make enquiry, make booking)\r\n> \r\n> 2. Test standard
        booking bar and same tabs A/B test (scrolling, tabs aren''t covered by booking
        bar, red bar for unavailability, green bar for available, make enquiry, make
        booking)\r\n> \r\n> 3. Test on mobile (that these changes don''t appear)\r\n>
        \r\n> 4. Test on other browsers\r\n> \r\n> 5. Test translations (no new translations)","created_at":"2014-08-19T11:07:22Z","updated_at":"2014-08-19T11:14:04Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c5b894db35c70c70c4f22df62e875def7ab4d772","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HouseTrip/HouseTrip-Web-App/pulls/6558/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HouseTrip/HouseTrip-Web-App/pulls/6558/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HouseTrip/HouseTrip-Web-App/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HouseTrip/HouseTrip-Web-App/issues/6558/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HouseTrip/HouseTrip-Web-App/statuses/b5d821c03a571267df3868d11dba1ef68e00a8cb","head":{"label":"HouseTrip:bookings/purple-booking-bar-new-tabs-76291634","ref":"bookings/purple-booking-bar-new-tabs-76291634","sha":"b5d821c03a571267df3868d11dba1ef68e00a8cb","user":{"login":"HouseTrip","id":142723,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142723?v=2","gravatar_id":"d8db298b62716cc389471867da61ddb6","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip","html_url":"https://github.com/HouseTrip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344965,"name":"HouseTrip-Web-App","full_name":"HouseTrip/HouseTrip-Web-App","owner":{"login":"HouseTrip","id":142723,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142723?v=2","gravatar_id":"d8db298b62716cc389471867da61ddb6","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip","html_url":"https://github.com/HouseTrip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HouseTrip/received_events","type":"Organization","site_admin":false},"private":true,"html_url":"https://github.com/HouseTrip/HouseTrip-Web-App","description":"Your
